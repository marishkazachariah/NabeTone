        A project where people can record or listen to stories, memories,
        sights and sounds about specific geographic locations. Listen to a story
        while experiencing being right where the story takes place. 
        <br></br>
        Stories are as personal as the relationship people have with the spaces they
        inhabit. Secret histories are unearthed, private truths unveiled, and
        tales as diverse as the city itself are discovered and shared. Whose
        voices are not part of the official story of your neighbourhood?
